		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>ChaloBEST aims to provide innovative solutions to questions faced every day by millions of urban commuters – how can I reach my destination?</p>
		<p>Today most Indians with smart phones or basic handsets are able to receive information in an instant. Despite this revolution in mobile connectivity, essential data about urban mobility remains difficult to find – bus frequencies, train schedules, street maps and point­to­point routing.</p>
		<p>We see mobiles as tools to re­imagine  transportation systems as social networks, empower commuters as citizens, and make public transit agencies more user­friendly, transparent and efficient.</p>
		<h2>History</h2>
		<p>We began in January 2011 as a studio-based learning experiment at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE). It developed further and gained several partners and students which made it into a unique partnership project of people and organisations who believe in freely and publicly available data for public benefit. The project also aims to assist the cause of public transport, in our opinion the only way possible to reduce the environmental burden of dense cities like Mumbai and the travel time within it.</p>
		<p>The ChaloBEST project is stricktly open source and any community can pick up our work and reproduce the project in their own cities. We have cooperations with initiatives in Pune, Chennai and Delhi for mutual support between our respective projects.</p>
		<h2>Current developments</h2>
		<p>ChaloBEST is currently in a stage of pre-public beta release. We are working hard to get our databases error free so that we can start testing it via the various developed media of communication.</p>
		<h3>- 31st August 2012 update -</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>SMS server is up! Even though our database work has not been fully completed, you can already use this service. Be ware of a few errors it might make till it has been declared ready for public beta.</li>
			<li>The website is under construction and should soon be able to reflect all bus routes through Greater Mumbai, collected as per area, bus stops and all stops in a route. The latest gadget is that you can see the bus frequencies (still experimental)</li>
			<li>The Android app has got a decent foundation but needs still a lot of work. We expect to be able to release a very early beta by the end of September.</li>
		</ul>
